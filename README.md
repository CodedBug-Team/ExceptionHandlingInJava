# ExceptionHandlingInJava

In general the term Exception means “a person or thing that is excluded from a general statement or does not follow a rule.” and Exception handling is process of responding to occurrence of the anomaly or exception. 

For Example, let’s take a scenario where you are filling an online form. Once you are done with it you try to submit it, but in case if you did not follow the guideline given with form. Like if you filled Phone number field with 9 digit instead of 10 then it will show you a appropriate message “Please fill the 10 digit mobile number”. In this case, form expected to have 10 digit number only filled in Mobile number field but the input given by user was deviating from guideline. So application form highlighted that there is an exception during the form filling using message and exception was handled. 

Exception handling in JAVA is same as above statement, developer will built an application that can handle mistake done by users with Try/Catch block or may be using some other ways. The main purpose of Exception handling is to ensure the smooth execution of application and application should not break down by any exception or anomaly such as ClassNotFound, IO, SQL, Remote etc and any anomalies can be handle.  

Types of Exception 
* Checked Exception
* Unchecked Exception
* Error

Among which there are only two main exceptions: checked and unchecked, where error is considered as unchecked throwable. <a href="http://p3lang.com/2017/11/exception-handling-java/">Read more</a>
